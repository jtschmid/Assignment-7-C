    <h2>History &amp; Development</h2>
    <p>
        Swimming emerged as a competitive recreational activity in the 1830s in England. 
        In 1828, the first indoor swimming pool, St George's Baths was opened to the public.
        By 1837, the National Swimming Society was holding regular swimming competitions in six artificial swimming pools, 
        built around London. The recreational activity grew in popularity and by 1880, when the first national governing body, 
        the Amateur Swimming Association was formed, there were already over 300 regional clubs in operation across the country. 
        Men's swimming became part of the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens. 
        In 1902, the Australian Richmond Cavill introduced freestyle to the Western world. 
        In 1908, the world swimming association, Fédération Internationale de Natation (FINA, now World Aquatics), was formed. 
        Women's swimming was introduced into the Olympics in 1912; the first international swim meet for women outside the Olympics was the 1922 
        Women's Olympiad. Butterfly was developed in the 1930s and was at first a variant of breaststroke, until it was accepted as a separate style in 1952. 
        FINA renamed itself World Aquatics in December 2022.
